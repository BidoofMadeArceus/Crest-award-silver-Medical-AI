I am currently working towards my silver crest award (google it if you don't know what it is).
For my silver crest award I am going to be creating an AI that predicts the toxcicity of compounds to
streamline the process of drug design.

If you are looking at the dataset and see I have got the toxcicity of a compound wrong please tell me.

note that this project is just a proof of concept and not intended to be fully accurate.
